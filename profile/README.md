# What is GigaChat?

GigaChat is an organization trying to create a voice base virtual assistent

# What is the problem?

With the increase in a variety of technology, many people have access to services such as IoT(internet of things), and applications. Technology helps improve people's productivity by organizing their ideas, making data use convenient, and accelerating our learning. 

One of the problems to consider are when people have trouble communicating with services effectively. With the help of a virtual assistant, it will allow for easier use between the user and the service. For people who don't struggle with using technology, using voice can be another great option over the alternatives such as writing, typing, and drawing.
